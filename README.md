# CBOW
CBOW stands for Continuous Bag of Words, which is a neural network architecture used for training word embeddings. 
Word embeddings are numerical representations of words, where each word is represented by a dense vector of real numbers.

In the CBOW model, the goal is to predict a target word given its surrounding context words in a sentence. 
The context words are used as input to the model, and the target word is the output. The model consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer contains one neuron for each context word, and the output layer contains one neuron for each possible target word. The hidden layer is where the word embeddings are learned.

During training, the weights of the neural network are updated using backpropagation to minimize the difference between the predicted target word and the actual target word. 
The word embeddings learned by the model can then be used for various NLP tasks, such as text classification, information retrieval, and machine translation.

The CBOW model is a simpler and faster alternative to the more complex and computationally expensive skip-gram model, which also learns word embeddings but in a different way. CBOW is especially useful for languages with less complex syntax, such as Chinese or Japanese.
